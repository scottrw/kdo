\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Service Positions}
\begin{description}
\item[Doshi] An ordained person who leads the service by offering incense and
leading prostrations and bows.
\item[Doan] Rings the bells.
\item[Tenken] Strikes the han (wooden block) to announce Wednesday evening
zazen, minds the lights, and opens the doors.
\item[Kokyo] Leads the chants during service.
\end{description}

\section{Explanation of Symbols}
The different bells are indicated by different symbols.

\subsection{Regular Rings of the Bells}

\begin{tabular}{llc}
Large Bell: & large red circle & \largebell \\
Small Bell: & small red dot & \smallbell \\
Zazen Bell: & small green diamond & \zazenbell
\end{tabular}

In addition to the regular rings, there are four sound effects that can be
produced on the large bell.

\subsection{Effects (\kern-.1ex Always on Large Bell)}
\begin{tabular}{llr}
Muffle: & red circle with $\times$ & \muffle \\
Bok: & red circle with slash & \bok \\
Clank: & red triangle & \clank
\end{tabular}

To produce a \muffle\ \emph{muffle}, hold the playing stick with two hands and hold it
firmly against the top of the bell to stop the ringing. Do not raise the
playing stick until the bell stops ringing. The playing stick should not make a
noise when it meets the top of the bell.

To produce a \bok\ \emph{bok}, hold the playing stick with two hands and bring it
down solidly against the top of the bell, then hold it in place. Do not remove
the playing stick until the bell has stopped ringing.

The difference between a bok and a muffle is whether the playing stick causes
the bell to ring when brought against the bell.

To produce a \clank\ \emph{clank}, grip the playing stick for the \emph{small bell}
like a pencil and bring the tip solidly against the side of the bell, holding
the playing stick against the bell until the bell stops ringing.

\section*{Doshi-Dependent Rings}
The timing of the second and third bell during long chants is determined by the
timing of the doshi's actions, as follows:

\begin{description}
\item[If the doshi goes up to offer incense.] The doshi will stand up and bow.
The doan rings the large bell as he bows. The doshi will go up to the altar and
offer chip incense, then will step back and bow to the altar. The doan rings
the bell as he bows.
\item[If the doshi stays sitting and puts hands in gassho.] Ring the bell as
the doshi's hands come up to gassho, and again as his hands come back down.
\end{description}

If the doshi does nothing, the doan does not ring the bells.

The approximate times to watch for the doshi's actions are indicated by
\doshidependent{blue text in italics.}

\section*{Using the Audio Equipment}
\subsection*{To turn on the audio equipment}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Press the red square button on the audio deck under the table. It will
light up and turn on the whole deck.
\item Bring up the master volume level toggle to the first rectangle.
\item Place the Lavalier next to the doshi's zabuton. Take care that the line
is neatly coiled and tucked under the clip.
\item Pick up the Sony Sound Recorder and turn it. The power button is on the
left side of the recorder. Pull down on the power button for 2 seconds.
\item Uncoil the headphone jacks under the cushions in front of the sound
table. Make sure the headphones are on the table for people to use if needed.
\item Take a seat on the zabuton on the floor next to the mixer. Once the
recorder is one, wait for the doshi to say ``Good evening,'' then hit the
record button. See the instruction sheet, ``Instructions for recording
lectures,'' sitting next to the mixer.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{At the end of the lecture}
When the doshi asks if there are any announcements, press the stop button on the
Sony Sound Recorder.

After the doshi concludes the service, open the zendo doors. Start with the
right one (if you are facing the altar) and then the left. Make sure they are
all the way open and the door catch has caught the door. The doshi and tenken
bow together syncronized with the doan bowing with the sangha.

After everyone has left the zendo, turn off the red power button on the mixer,
place the microphones in the bags, and place them below the sound table.
