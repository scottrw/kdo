We reflect on the efforts that brought us this food\\
\indent and consider how it comes to us.\\
We reflect on our virtue and practice\\
\indent and whether we are worthy of this offering.\\
Understanding greed as the source of delusion,\\
Appreciating this meal for sustaining our life.\\
To express wisdom and charity, we now receive this food.

We offer our efforts to the three treasures,\\
To the four benefactors,\\
And to myriad beings in the six realms,\\
So that all may be equally nourished.

We share this food to end all evil,\\
To cultivate every good;\\
And to encourage clarity of mind.\\
Let everyone realize the Buddha way.
