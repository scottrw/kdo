\chant{songOfTheJewelMirrorSamadhi}{Song of the Jewel Mirror Samadhi}{
  The teaching of thusness has been intimately communicated by Buddhas and
  ancestors. Now you have it, so keep it well. Filling a silver bowl with snow,
  hiding a heron in the moonlight, \largebell\ taken as similar they're not the
  same; when you mix them, you know where they are. The meaning is not in the
  words, yet it responds to the inquiring impulse. Move and you are trapped;
  miss and you fall into doubt and vacillation. Turning away and touching are
  both wrong, for it is like a massive fire. Just to depict it in literary form
  is to stain it with defilement. It is bright just at midnight, it doesn't
  appear at dawn. It acts as a guide for beings, its use removes all pains.
  Although it is not fabricated, it is not without speech. It is like facing a
  jewel mirror; form and image behold each other---you are not it, in truth it
  is you. Like a babe in the world, in five aspects complete; it does not go or
  come, nor rise nor stand. ``Baba wawa''---is there anything said or not?
  Ultimately it does not apprehend anything because its speech is not yet
  correct. It is like the six lines of the illumination hexagram: relative and
  ultimate interact---piled up, they make three, the complete transformation
  makes five. It is like the taste of the five-flavored herb, like a diamond
  thunderbolt. Subtly included within the true, inquiry and response come up
  together. Communing with the source, travel the pathways, embrace the
  territory and treasure the road.  Respecting this is fortunate; do not neglect
  it. Naturally real yet inconceivable, it is not within the province of
  delusion or enlightenment. With causal conditions, time and season,
  quiescently it shines bright. In its fineness it fits into spacelessness, in
  its greatness it is utterly beyond location. A hairsbreadth's deviation will
  fail to accord with the proper attunement. Now there are sudden and gradual in
  which teachings and approaches arise. Once basic approaches are distinguished,
  then there are guiding rules.  But even though the basis is reached and the
  approach comprehended, true eternity still flows. Outwardly still while
  inwardly moving, like a tethered colt, a trapped rat---the ancient sages
  pitied them and bestowed upon them the teaching. According to their delusions,
  they called black as white; when erroneous imaginations cease, the acquiescent
  mind realizes itself. If you want to conform to the ancient way, please
  observe the sages of former times. When about to fulfill the way of
  Buddhahood, one gazed at a tree for ten eons. Like a battle-scarred tiger,
  like a horse with shanks gone gray. Because there is the common, there are
  jewel pedestals, fine clothing; because there is the startlingly different,
  there are house cat and cow. Yi with his archer's skill could hit a target at
  a hundred paces. But when arrow-points meet head on, what has this to do with
  the power of skill? When the wooden man begins to sing, the stone woman gets
  up dancing; it's not within reach of feeling or discrimination---how could it
  admit of consideration in thought? Ministers serve their lords, children obey
  their parents; not obeying is not filial and not serving is no help. Practice
  secretly \smallbell\ working within, like a fool, like an idiot \smallbell\ 
  just to continue in this way is called the host within the host.  \bok

  The mind of the great sage of India is intimately transmitted from west to
  east. While human faculties are sharp or dull, the way has no northern or
  southern ancestors. \largebell\ The spiritual source shines clear in the
  light, the branching streams flow on in the dark. Grasping at things is surely
  delusion, according with sameness is still not enlightenment. All the objects
  of the senses interact and yet do not. Interacting brings involvement,
  otherwise each keeps its place. Sights vary in quality and form, sounds differ
  in pleasing or harsh. Refined and common speech come together in the dark,
  clear and murky phrases are distinguished in the light. The four elements
  return to their natures just as a child turns to its mother.
  \doshidependent{Fire heats, wind moves, water wets, earth is solid, eye and
    sights, ear and sounds, nose and smells, tongue and tastes. Thus with each
    and every thing, depending on these roots the leaves spread forth. Trunk and
    branches share the essence, revered and common each has its speech. In the
    light there is darkness, but don't take it as darkness. In dark there is
    light, but don't see it as light. Light and dark oppose one another like the
    front and back foot in walking. Each of the myriad things has its merit
  expressed according to function and place.} Phenomena exist, box and lid fit,
  principle responds, arrow points meet.  Hearing the words understand the
  meaning; don't set up standards of your own.  If you don't understand the way
  right before you, how will you know the path as you walk? Progress is not a
  matter of far or near, but if you are confused \smallbell\ mountains and
  rivers block your way.  \smallbell\ I respectfully urge you who study the

  This is what should be accomplished by the one who is wise, who seeks the
  good, and has obtained peace. \largebell\ Let one be strenuous, upright, and
  sincere, without pride, easily contented, and joyous. Let one not be submerged
  by the things of the world. Let one not take upon oneself the burden of
  riches. Let one's senses be controlled. Let one be wise but not puffed up and
  let one not desire great possessions even for one's family. Let one do nothing
  that is mean or that the wise would reprove. May all beings be happy. May they
  be joyous and live in safety. All living beings, whether weak or strong, in
  high or middle or low realms of existence, small or great, visible or
  invisible, near or far, born or to be born, may all beings be happy. Let no
  one deceive another nor despise any being in any state. Let none by anger or
  hatred wish harm to another. Even as a mother at the risk of her life watches
  over and protects her only child, so with a boundless mind should one cherish
  all living things, suffusing love over the entire world, above, below, and all
  around, without limit. So let one cultivate an infinite good will toward the
  whole world.  Standing or walking, sitting or lying down, during all one's
  waking hours, let one practice the way with gratitude. Not holding to fixed
  views, endowed with insight, freed from sense appetites, one who achieves
  \smallbell\ the way will be freed \smallbell\ from the duality of birth and

  Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva, when deeply practicing prajna paramita, clearly
  saw that all five aggregates are empty and thus relieved all suffering.
  Shariputra, form does not differ from emptiness, emptiness does not differ
  from form. \largebell\ Form itself is emptiness, emptiness itself form.
  Sensations, perceptions, formations, and consciousness are also like this.
  Shariputra, all dharmas are marked by emptiness; they neither arise nor cease,
  are neither defiled nor pure, neither increase nor decrease. Therefore, given
  emptiness, there is no form, no sensation, no perception, no formation, no
  consciousness; no eyes, no ears, no nose, no tongue, no body, no mind; no
  sight, no sound, no smell, no taste, no touch, no object of mind; no realm of
  sight\dots\ no realm of mind consciousness. There is neither ignorance nor
  extinction of ignorance\dots\ neither old age and death, nor extinction of old
  age and death; no suffering, no cause, no cessation, no path; no knowledge and
  no attainment.  \doshidependent{With nothing to attain, a bodhisattva relies
  on prajna paramita and thus the mind is without hindrance. Without
  hindrance, there is no fear.  Far beyond all inverted views, one realizes
  nirvana. All buddhas of past, present, and future rely on prajna paramita and
  thereby attain unsurpassed, complete, perfect enlightenment.} Therefore know the
  prajna paramita as the great miraculous mantra, the great bright mantra, the
  supreme mantra, the incomparable mantra, which removes all suffering and is
  true, not false.  Therefore we proclaim the prajna paramita mantra, the mantra
