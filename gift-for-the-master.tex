Dedication

For Roshi Les Kaye, 
on your 50th Zeniversary











%main content


Once upon a time, in Valley Siliconia, there was an ancient temple by the name of ‘Kannon Do’. ‘Kannon Do’ meant ‘Place of Compassion’, and many people traveled to this temple to hear words of wisdom from the abbott. The abbott of the temple was a wise, old zen master, and word got around that soon it would be his 50th anniversary of practicing The Way.

The priests and students of the temple at once set about planning a great celebration. “We will invite everyone!” they said. “We will shower him with gifts!” “He will be so surprised!” But while they went about eagerly with preparations, one young monk sat troubled in the corner.

“A gift for the master?” she thought, “What could I possibly give to the master that would be enough to thank him for 50 years of dedicated practice?” She faced the wall, and pondered this some more. “He doesn’t need any new clothes. His robes are always well cared for. He already has scrolls and paintings. He already has ceremonial cups and incense. He has a home, a garden, and a gym membership at 24 Hour Fitness!” And the more she thought about it, the more confounded she became, until it was a koan that troubled her day and night. 

“What gift can you give to a zen master, who already has everything?”

She contemplated this koan for days. Days turned into weeks. But every idea that came seemed far too inadequate, too trivial to thank someone for 50 years of their life. She was lost deep in concentration when suddenly she looked at the calendar and realized the date of the celebration had snuck up on her. The ceremony was tonight and she had no choice but to go to the temple empty-handed.

People had traveled from many distant lands to come see the master that evening. The zendo was packed with the happy faces of students and friends. With a beautiful ceremony, the sangha thanked the master for his profound dedication. Then, one by one, the sangha members presented their gifts of appreciation. 

“Dear master! We know how much you take interest in the indigenous peoples. Here, we would like to present you with the full BBC series on the Aborigenes!” the priestess smiled as she handed over the eloquently wrapped documentary dvds. 

“Kind teacher!” spoke up another young woman. “I remember how much you appreciate fine pottery. I have such fond memories of listening to your teachings while we spun ceramic cups at Tassajara. Here, I have brought you this fine, porcelain tea set from my travels in Taiwan. Please accept it as a small token of my gratitude!”

“Beloved abbott!” came the chorus of a group of young monks, “To thank you, we have brought you a most delicious triple layered cake from the finest bakery in Valley Siliconia, with your name painted in purple frosting!” And they presented a glowing frosted cake, shimmering beneath golden candles.

“Dear teacher! Here, we have brought you a bouquet of fine flowers for you to share with your wife, Miss Mary!”

“Mon amí! C’est un certificat pour le meilleur dîner au restaurant Chez TJ’s! S'il vous plaît profiter de la meilleure cuisine française de moi, ton serviteur et ami.”

Dozens of people stepped forward presenting cards and gifts and words of appreciation. At last, there was no one left but her, so the young monk stepped trembling forward. She looked into the honest eyes of the old master, as he sat cross-legged under a simple brown sash. She reached out her hands, but there was nothing to give. 

“My hands are empty master.” She looked down at the floor, tears brimming in her eyes. “I am sorry.” 

The master looked at the young monk curiously. After a pause, he asked, “These empty hands, tell me, what are they good for?”

She thought a moment. “Well, they are good for moving things. Good for washing dishes and scrubbing floors and windows. They are good for pouring water, tea and coffee! They are good with a pen, with a sewing needle, with a stirring spoon! They are good with many things!” Her eyes brightened, “Is there something I can do for you, master?”

He answered, “The seeds that I planted here, will you water them?”

“Yes, master, I will water the seeds that you planted!”

“The altar I build, will you dust it for me?”

“Yes, master, I will dust the altar you built.”

“The doors to our zendo - will you open them for all seekers of The Way?”

“Yes, master, I will open the doors for all seekers of The Way!”

“And when the morning bell rings, will you just sit still?”

“Yes, master! When the morning bell rings, I will sit very still.”

The old master smiled deeply. “These hands are a wonderful gift! I am glad you thought of it!”

That evening the courtyard was lit with sparkling lights and the joyous voices of celebration. And there was much cake eating and tea sipping at the sangha house of Kannon Do.

The End.
